# Enhanced Preprocessing Notebooks - Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've created comprehensive preprocessing notebooks for the IBM AML Multi-GNN model based on the analysis of HI-Small_report.json and sample_subgraph.gpickle. The implementation focuses on addressing the extreme class imbalance (~0.1% illicit transactions) and creating enhanced features for better GNN performance.

## Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Node Features (Account-level)
```python
# 15+ comprehensive features per account
node_features = {
    'transaction_count': len(account_transactions),
    'total_sent': sent_amount,
    'total_received': received_amount,
    'avg_amount': avg_transaction_amount,
    'max_amount': max_transaction_amount,
    'temporal_span': transaction_time_span,
    'transaction_frequency': transactions_per_day,
    'currency_diversity': unique_currencies,
    'bank_diversity': unique_banks,
    'night_ratio': night_transactions_ratio,
    'weekend_ratio': weekend_transactions_ratio,
    'is_crypto_bank': crypto_bank_indicator,
    'is_international': multi_currency_indicator,
    'is_high_frequency': high_frequency_indicator
}
```

### 2. Enhanced Edge Features (Transaction-level)
```python
# 12+ comprehensive features per transaction
edge_features = [
    # Cyclic temporal features (6 features)
    hour_sin, hour_cos, day_sin, day_cos, month_sin, month_cos,
    # Amount features (3 features)
    amount_paid_log, amount_received_log, amount_ratio,
    # Categorical features (3 features)
    currency_encoded, format_encoded, bank_encoded
]
```

### 3. Advanced Class Imbalance Handling
```python
# Multi-strategy approach
def handle_class_imbalance(X, y, strategy='smote'):
    if strategy == 'smote':
        smote = SMOTE(random_state=42, k_neighbors=3)
        X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
    
    # Cost-sensitive learning
    class_weights = {
        0: 1.0,    # Legitimate transactions
        1: 100.0   # Illicit transactions (10x cost for false negatives)
    }
```

### 4. Memory-Efficient Processing
```python
# Sample-based processing for testing
def load_aml_data(data_path, sample_size=10000):
    transactions = pd.read_csv(trans_file, nrows=sample_size)
    # Process in chunks to avoid memory issues
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced preprocessing notebooks provide a comprehensive solution for the IBM AML Multi-GNN model. The key is to start with the simple notebook for testing and validation, then gradually scale to the full implementation with advanced features.

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Start with simple notebook** - test and validate first
2. **Handle class imbalance carefully** - crucial for 0.1% imbalance
3. **Monitor memory usage** - essential for large datasets
4. **Test incrementally** - validate each feature type
5. **Scale gradually** - from sample to full dataset

The implementation should be done incrementally, starting with the most critical features and gradually adding complexity while monitoring performance and memory usage.
